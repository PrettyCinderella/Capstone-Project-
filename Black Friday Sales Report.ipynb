    "\n",
    "Toys\n",
    "\n",
    "Apply a small discount (5–10%). This category is already performing well, so aggressive discounting is unnecessary. Modest incentives or bundle pairings can maintain momentum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Use a medium discount (10–15%). This strikes a balance between encouraging purchases and protecting margins. Bundling accessories can also improve perceived value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Food\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce a moderate-to-high discount (15–20%). A price cut may help improve satisfaction and encourage repeat purchases, especially for everyday items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommend a high discount (20–25%). Strong markdowns will help reposition this category and improve engagement, especially when paired with seasonal promotions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decorations\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a high discount (25–30%). While satisfaction is high, sales are low so the goal is to boost visibility and sales volume quickly.\n",

    "Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Retailers looking to boost both sales and revenue during promotional campaigns can benefit from a strategic discounting approach informed by data. The campaign analysis reveals that product performance varies significantly across categories, and discount levels must be tailored accordingly. Toys, which already perform well, require only minimal incentives—small discounts between 5% and 10% or bundled offers are sufficient to maintain momentum. Electronics benefit from moderate discounts of 10% to 15%, striking a balance between attracting buyers and preserving profit margins. Food products, being everyday essentials, respond well to slightly higher discounts in the 15% to 20% range, which can improve satisfaction and repeat purchases. Clothing, which showed weaker performance, requires stronger markdowns of 20% to 25%, especially when paired with seasonal promotions. Decorations, despite high satisfaction, suffer from low sales and should be promoted with aggressive discounts of 25% to 30% to increase visibility and volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "The campaign’s revenue model supports these strategies. With an R² score of 0.48 and a low RMSE of 0.028, the model reliably predicts revenue outcomes. It identifies quantity sold and discount level as the most influential factors, while satisfaction, weekday, and weekend timing have minimal predictive impact. The model forecasts a revenue increase of 0.03 units, or 9.11%, confirming that smart discounting and volume growth are key drivers of success.\n",
    "Further analysis of discount levels from 0% to 50% shows a clear upward trend in predicted revenue. Customer satisfaction remains stable across all levels, indicating that deeper discounts do not harm the shopping experience. Weekend sales consistently outperform weekday sales, with weekend revenue averaging 143% higher. The average margin between weekend and weekday revenue is ₦53.71, highlighting stronger customer engagement during weekends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance improves notably at 30% discount, where weekend revenue turns positive and weekday losses shrink. At 40% and 50%, both weekday and weekend sales show strong growth, and overall campaign performance peaks. These findings support the conclusion that discounting is most effective from 30% upward, with weekends offering the best opportunity for high-impact promotions. Retailers are encouraged to adopt aggressive pricing strategies where needed, without compromising customer satisfaction.\n",
